# Privacy

This plugin sends the parameters you (or your agent) pass to its tools — `content`, `question`, `bucket`, `memory_id` — to the Engram REST API at `https://api.lumetra.io` (or the self-hosted base URL you configured via `LLM_ENGRAM_API_BASE`). Memories are stored under your Engram tenant, scoped by the API key you provided via `LLM_ENGRAM_API_KEY` (or `ENGRAM_API_KEY`).

The plugin does not collect, log, or transmit data to any third party other than the Engram service you've explicitly authorized. The plugin does not read other `llm` resources (logs, templates, other plugins' state, local files) — only the parameters supplied to each tool call.

For Engram's own data-handling and retention policy, see <https://lumetra.io/privacy>.
